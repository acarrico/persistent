Persistent data structures in Racket.

I wrote these as I was learning about persistent data structures. I was also interested in learning typed racket, so I started this is typed racket, but quickly ran into trouble with the nested datatype (see the thread "fingertree / nested datatype" in the Racket Users mailing list strarting 2013-04-10). This was starting to get distracting, so I backed off to regular racket. I have subsequently noticed one bug that would have been caught by typed racket :(.
